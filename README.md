# Programming For Big Data

This assignment requires you to compile a set of data, load this data into hdfs and write a mapreduce
process that will extract, expand the functionality of the mar-reduce process and present the
data as outlined in the following sections.

## Background

Analysis of letter frequency in text has been used in a variety of different areas, including encryption,
word puzzle games, even the television show The Wheel of Fortune. Linotype machines which were

distribution also depends on the subject under discussion in the text. Scientific texts, press
reporting, religious texts, general fiction will all display slightly different letter frequency
distributions. Accurate average
